we are learning git diff command
this file is added to test the command


git branch feature1

branch can only be created from existing branch
branches are reference to commit , no code is copied 

HEAD determines which brnahc you are at currently 

git checkout feature1
git switch feature1

switching back to master :

git switch master 
git merge feature1 
git merge <name of the branch to be merged into the branch you are on >

fast forward merge 

switching back directly to master and moving it to the latest commit of feature via merge

Recursive three way merge :

git switch master
git merge feature1

earlier both branches have commit ID of file1

changes made on both branches :
master branch --   commit id for file 2
feature branch --  commit id for modified file1 and index.html

just moving the branch to look at new commit won't do merge here

to resolve this we do recursive 3 way merge

git switch master
git merge feature1

it will combine commit ID for file2 , modified file1 and index.html
and it will create new commit ID for merge.

git will choose when to go for fast forward or 3 way recursive merge
delete the feature branch-- git branch -d feature1

git switch feature1== when we do git switch feature1 HEAD goes to feature1
now if we do git branch feature2

branch are just reference to CommitID
New branch doe not change HEAD unless switched.

git branch feature1 feature2 ==> HEAD would be sitting with master branch.



git clone <remote repository address> :

when we clone from remote branch to local machine then 
git histroy graph also copied to local
branch main gets created
apart from it one more branch :origin/main gets created : this does not heappen when we do git init.

if we have any other feature branch than it create :origin/feature

origin/* branch are for remote tracking only , cannot switch or commit in local 

git branch -r to see this branches

First case :

Now some other team member pushed to remote github with commit file2 
local changes are remote github are out of sync. hence to solve this problem we need to follow below approach
git fetch 
origin/main of local will track the latest commit
here no changes have been done in local branch then fast forward merge would be suitable :
git merge origin/main

second case :
what if we have changes at both end remote and local repository:

commitid for file 2 in branch main at remote github
commitid for file 3 in branch main at local repository.

now if we run git fetch in local repo then it will create diversing branch looking for commit ID for file 2

now if we run git merge origin/main

this will run 3 way merge

git pull ==> instead of git fetch and git merge git pull can do the same thing.

how to push in remote github

git push 

third case :

if we have changes at both remote githun and local and we donot want to fetch or pull

then git push will throw error .
git push -f can be run [ this will drop the changes from remote repository and will move the chanes from local to remote repository]

this is not recommed unless in deep trouble.

check which branches are merged or not :

git branch --merged

which are not merged by below command :
git branch --no-merged

see log for all branches 
git log --all --oneline --graph

git branch --all [ all branches]

git branch -r [ remote branches ]



remote origin mapped to :

git remote -v

// do some new changes to the local file and move local branch ahead of the remote repository.

// do some new changes to the local file and move local branch ahead of the remote repository.

If branch does not exists on remote github and you have created new branch
in your local then you may use 
git push origin HEAD 

command 
or create new branch in github and then push it again from repository.

// Browse history and commits

git log 

git log --oneline [ HEAD branches shows up]

git log --oneline --all 

git log --oneline --all --graph

git graph shows history in real awesome way.

git log --oneline --all --stat

git log --oneline --all --patch

git show commitid [ to see particular commit]

git ls-tree commitid

git rm file  [ remove file from local and staging area]

Pull Request (PR) 

Request to pull the changes from one branch to another .

pull request allows collaborators of project

gitlab -- its merge request


==============================================================

Webhook Vs API ==>

Jenkins calling GitHub APIs continuously :

most of the time APIs return stagnant data .
github server will be bombarded 
Apps will exceeds API limits.

What is webhook ?
Instead of Jenkins call Github , GitHub let Jenkins know when new changes are there :
GitHub will do a POST call to your Appif repo changes.
Lightweight
Realtime
Webhooks are automated messages sent from apps when something happens. They have a message—or payload—and are sent to a unique URL—essentially the app'

Git Branching Strategy 
Trunk vs Git Flow

Trunk  Branch Strategy 
one main branch remains 
If we have to develop some feature we create feature branch and then merge it with main branch down the line.

Small frequent updates to a core trunk 
    Code rview , feedback done via pull request.
Feature branches are short lived
Use feature flags
Most popular branching strategy for DevOps Practices.
Notable companies using trunk based development - GitHub , Google

Git Flow :

Specific Roles to different branches
    Develop branch created from main
    release branch created from Develop
    feature branches created from Develop
    When a feature is complete that feature branch is merged into Develop.
    Release branch created from develop for final review
    release branch merged to both main and Develop.
    If an issue is found , hotfix created from main branch.
    Once fixed hotfix merged to botj Develop and main.

works well in release based workflow
works well with onboarding teams new to git 
    generally requires a release manager.

================================================
To revert a particular commit use git revert 
git revert CommitID
Pressing q without : also works
Revert will come as commit.

=================================================

git reset CommitID
git reset COmmitID --hard

with git reset no additional commitID where as git revert does

==================================================

Rebase & rebase vs Merge

regular merge -- >  regular merge from feature to master it will create commitID

rebase -- creates cleaner commit history 
easier to navigate with git log
rebase re writes commit history
original commit id goes
